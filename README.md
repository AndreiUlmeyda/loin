# loin
Search-as-you-type cli frontend for the [buku](https://github.com/jarun/Buku) bookmarks manager using [peco](https://github.com/peco/peco).

## features
* View a list of your bookmarks and, while typing, have the list filtered accordingly as well as instantaneously.
* Hit enter on the desired bookmark and it will open in your default browser.

## usage
Simply invoke the script inside a terminal, start typing and hit enter when you found what you were looking for (the latter  being great life advice,too). Refer to the peco manual to find out all the shenanigans it allows for.

## dependencies
* [buku](https://github.com/jarun/Buku)
* [peco](https://github.com/peco/peco)
* [jq](https://github.com/stedolan/jq)

## disclaimer
This is still experimental. At least the issue of the rather unstructured appearance of lines inside peco needs to be sorted out. For this I will need feedback from people interested in using it. See the issues page.

## lore
While seemingly immature at first glans, this tool was given a short name that is easy to remember and type. Notice the small, smooth outward spiral you have to inscribe with your fingers during invocation and compare it to the wandering all across keyboard land in a fever dream that peco and others suffer your troubled hands to do. All this while honoring L贸in, Gimli's long lost brother become high librarian of Thorins Halls. L贸in, fruit of the loins of Gl贸in, son of Gr贸in. Genitals.
